# GotBot Form

This is a simple form that utilizes all the benefits of the MEAN Stack. It comes with baked in validation, toast notifications and an svg animation you can bob your head with while you fill out the form.

## Prerequisites

- There are none!

We're utilizing the strength of [docker](https://www.docker.com/) so we'll let the containers do the heavy lifting...

You do need docker but I'm sure you already knew that ðŸ¤”.

## Getting started

Clone the project using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/RobinSJames/got-bot-form.git
```

Then move into the cloned repo and type the following command:

```bash
docker-compose build
```

Depending on how fast your interent speed is or whether you have similar files cached... this could take a while.

Once the build is complete run the project by typing the following command to get it running:

```bash
docker-compose up
```

You should now be able to view the project on [http://localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200).
